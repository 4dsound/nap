	 * To draw an object with a Material, you need to use a MaterialInstance. MaterialInstance contains the
	 * runtime data for drawing a Material. MaterialInstance is intended to be used as a property in Components. 
	 * It needs to be initialized based on a MaterialInstanceResource object to fill it's runtime data. 
	 * init() needs to be called from the ComponentInstance's init() function. Before drawing, make sure to call 
	 * update() to update the uniforms and samplers. A descriptor will be returned that can be used to issue
	 * the Vulkan draw call.
	 *
	 * Multiple MaterialInstances can share a single Material and a single MaterialInstance can override Material 
	 * properties on a per-instance basis. This means that you can set uniform or texture data on Material level, 
	 * which means that, as long as the property isn't overridden, you will set it for all MaterialInstances in one
	 * go. If you set a property on MaterialInstance level, you will set it only for that MaterialInstance.
	 * 
	 * It is also possible to set uniform or texture state on a single MaterialInstance multiple times per frame. 
	 * When multiple draws are performed with the frame, the state at the point of draw will be used.
	 *
	 * Performance note: changing the Depth mode or Blend mode frequently on a single MaterialInstance is not recommended,
	 * as it requires a rebuild of the entire GPU pipeline. If changing it per frame is required, consider using multiple
	 * MaterialInstance objects and switch between them instead.
